"Always aim higher than you believe you can reach. So often, you'll
discover that when your talents are set free by your imagination, you
can achieve any goal. If people offer their help or wisdom as you go
through life, accept it gretefully. You can learn much from those who
have gone before you. But never be afraid or hesitant to step off the
accepted path and head off in your own direction if your heart tells
you that it's the right way for you. Always believe that you will
ultimately succeed at whatever you do, and never forget the value of
persistence, discipline, and determination. You are meant to be whatever
you dream of becoming."

 -- Andy Wu always believes it.
